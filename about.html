## About


How would you use open data to improve the lives of Winnipeggers? A GPS-based live feed of current air quality conditions? A visualized ‘persona’ of every neighbourhood based on census data? Or discover and visualize a correlation between the number of trees on a street and traffic congestion?
 
Whether you are a hacker, developer, statistician or new to open data, join us for a fun-filled day of imagination, collaboration, and coding. We’ll be using the City of Winnipeg’s open data to present to meaningful and fresh ideas on how data can improve the lives of Winnipeggers.
